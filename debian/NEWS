ruby1.9 (1.9.1.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  $LOAD_PATH is changed in Ruby 1.9.1-p0 as the following:

    ["/usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.9.1",
     "/usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.9.1/i486-linux",
     "/usr/local/lib/site_ruby",
     "/usr/lib/ruby1.9/vendor_ruby/1.9.1",
     "/usr/lib/ruby1.9/vendor_ruby/1.9.1/i486-linux",
     "/usr/lib/ruby1.9/vendor_ruby",
     "/usr/lib/ruby1.9/1.9.1",
     "/usr/lib/ruby1.9/1.9.1/i486-linux",
     "."]

  This changes was introduced by the upstream author. Ruby 1.9.1 may be
  incompatible with older version of Ruby.  So we reject old "i386-linux"
  directory from $LOAD_PATH.

  If you have libraries in old $LOAD_PATH, please rebuild it with this version
  of ruby1.9-dev package.
